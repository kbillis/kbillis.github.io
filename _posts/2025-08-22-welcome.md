Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to my personal GitHub Pages site.  

Iâ€™m BK, a scientist and data professional with more than 14 years of experience in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science.  

Iâ€™ll use this space to share my projects, pipelines, and thoughts on bioinformatics, large-scale data integration, and open science. Stay tuned!
