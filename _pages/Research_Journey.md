![Map of My Journey](/assets/images/me_map.jpg)

## First Studies
My research career bridges genetics, bioinformatics, and data analysis, driven by a commitment to data-driven insights that advance both scientific understanding and applied healthcare solutions.  

My academic journey began with a foundation in genetics and plants biology at **[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/)**, including a six-month exchange program in biotechnology at a masterâ€™s level at **[UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano â€“ FacoltÃ  di Agraria](https://www.unimi.it/en)**.  

Building on this, I pursued a **Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics** at **[Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm)**, where my thesis focused on **plant-pathogen interactions**, specifically investigating the role of transcription factors and secreted proteins in host-pathogen dynamics.  

Later, during an internship at the **Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB-FORTH)** in Crete, I delved into **RNA interference (RNAi)**, honing my skills in both wet-lab and computational techniques and cementing my transition into computational biology.

## Advancing Computational Biology and RNA-seq at JGI
My early professional work at the **[Joint Genome Institute (JGI)](https://jgi.doe.gov/)** under the **U.S. Department of Energy** focused on developing workflows and visualization tools for early **RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)** - [Early RNAseq pipeline](https://escholarship.org/content/qt0fz7q27j/qt0fz7q27j.pdf) - data analysis, essential for microbial research.  

At a time when RNA-seq was an emerging technique, I developed one of the **first pipelines for expression data** and web tools within the **[Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/)** system. 

This role sparked my **PhD research**, examining transcriptomic responses to environmental stress in cyanobacteria (*Synechococcus sp.* and *Synechocystis*). My thesis revealed adaptive mechanisms in response to stress, including:  
- Differential gene expression,  
- Evidence of antisense genes,  
- Transcriptional mutagenesis,  
- Reverse transcriptaseâ€“like proteins.  

My PhD was conducted while working full-time for **[European Bioinformatics Institute - EMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)** and in collaboration with **[Aristotle University](https://www.auth.gr/en/school/bio-en/)**, **[National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center](http://nersc.gov/)** and **JGI**.

## Pioneering Genomic Resources with Ensembl
A defining stage of my career was at the **[European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)** and the **[Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/)**.  

Here, I contributed to one of the worldâ€™s most critical genomic resources: the **[Ensembl platform](https://www.ensembl.org/)**. Key projects included:  

- **GRCh38 human genome annotation** (the current human reference genome)  
- **Illumina Human BodyMap project**  
- **The Human Pangenome Project** (featured on the cover of *Nature*)  
- Pipelines for **non-coding RNAs** (lncRNA) and **immune genes** (IG/TR)  


I also led **multi-genome annotations** (primates, rodents), which laid the foundation for scalable high-throughput genome analysis at Ensembl.  
My contributions significantly expanded Ensemblâ€™s role in global human genetics, enabling **high-quality genomic data access** for researchers, clinicians, and pharma R&D teams.

## International Collaborations and Industry Partnerships
During my time at Ensembl, I collaborated closely with academia and industry, tailoring genomic data resources to diverse needs.  


I contributed to **20+ custom genomics projects**, covering:  
- Model organism annotations  
- Single-cell experiments  
- Biomarker discovery  
- Therapeutic target identification  

I also supervised and mentored junior scientists, introducing **bioinformatics, cloud infrastructure, and containerized workflows** into production pipelines.

## Translational Bioinformatics and Healthcare Data
Following Ensembl, I transitioned into **translational bioinformatics** roles bridging research and healthcare.  

At **[Transition Bio](https://www.transition.bio/)** (Cambridge & Boston), I integrated **multi-omics data and machine learning predictions** into drug discovery, focusing on **biomolecular condensates** and therapeutic targets.  

At **[EULAR â€“ European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology](https://www.eular.org/)**, I built **secure cloud-based platforms** for clinical and omics data collection, enabling:  
- Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, BCR/TCR-seq analysis  
- FAIR-compliant data sharing  
- Patient-focused translational research  

These projects required close collaboration with **patient groups, clinicians, advocacy organizations, and pharmaceutical partners**.
