I am a bioinformatician and healthcare data expert with a PhD and over 14 years of experience at the intersection of biology, data science, and translational research. My career has focused on developing scalable bioinformatics tools, analyzing complex multi-omics datasets, and building high-throughput pipelines for human genetics, microbiome, and clinical research.

With a strong grounding in biology and expertise in software engineering, cloud/HPC workflows, and novel technologies, I specialize in turning complex biological data into actionable insights. I am recognized for bridging computational and experimental teams, mentoring collaborators, and leading projects that deliver patient-centered impact.

What distinguishes me is an end-to-end perspective across the R&D spectrumâ€”from genome annotation and large-scale data integration to biomarker discovery, translational analytics, and patient-facing platforms. My work has been published in Nature, Science, and Nucleic Acids Research, and has been cited more than 20,000 times, underscoring both its scientific rigor and its wide impact across global research and pharma R\&D teams.
