I'm a curious bioinformatician and healthcare data expert with a PhD and over 14 years of experience working at the intersection of biology, data science, and translational research. My work has centered on developing scalable bioinformatics tools, analyzing complex data, and building high-throughput pipelines for human genetics, microbiome, and multi-omics datasets. With a strong foundation in biology and deep expertise in software engineering, cloud/HPC workflows, and machine learning, I understand requirements and translate complex biological data into actionable insights. I'm known for bridging computational and experimental teams, mentoring collaborators, and delivering impactful, patient-centered research through clear communication and thoughtful project leadership. What sets me apart is an end-to-end perspective across the R&D spectrumâ€”from genome annotation and large-scale data integration to biomarker discovery, wet-lab collaboration, translational analytics, and patient-facing platforms. My contributions have been published in Nature, Science, and Nucleic Acids Research, with over 20,000 citations, reflecting both scientific rigor and broad community impact across thousands of researchers and pharmaceutical teams worldwide.
