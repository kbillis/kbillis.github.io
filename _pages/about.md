I am a curious bioinformatician and healthcare data professional with a PhD and many years of experience at the intersection of biological challenges and data science. My career has focused on building scalable data solutions, developing high-throughput analysis pipelines, and applying machine learning and AI methods to extract actionable insights from complex biological and healthcare datasets.
I have adapted to and continue learning innovative technologies to ensure data can drive discovery, improve patient outcomes, and support evidence-based decision-making. I also bring strong project management experience, bridging technical and stakeholder needs in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments.
