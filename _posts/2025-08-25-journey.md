# My Research Journey

## First Studies
My research career bridges genetics, bioinformatics, and data analysis, driven by a commitment to data-driven insights that advance both scientific understanding and applied healthcare solutions.  

My academic journey began with a foundation in genetics and biology at **[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/)**, including a six-month exchange program in biotechnology at a master’s level at **[Università degli Studi di Milano – Facoltà di Agraria](https://www.unimi.it/en)**.  

Building on this, I pursued a **Master’s in Bioinformatics** at **[Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm)**, where my thesis focused on **plant-pathogen interactions**, specifically investigating the role of transcription factors and secreted proteins in host-pathogen dynamics.  

Later, during an internship at the **Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB-FORTH)** in Crete, I delved into **RNA interference (RNAi)**, honing my skills in both wet-lab and computational techniques and cementing my transition into computational biology.

## Advancing Computational Biology and RNA-seq at JGI
My early professional work at the **[Joint Genome Institute (JGI)](https://jgi.doe.gov/)** under the **U.S. Department of Energy** focused on developing workflows and visualization tools for early **RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)** data analysis, essential for microbial research.  

At a time when RNA-seq was an emerging technique, I developed one of the **first pipelines for expression data** and web tools within the **[Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/)** system.

This role sparked my **PhD research**, examining transcriptomic responses to environmental stress in cyanobacteria (*Synechococcus sp.* and *Synechocystis*). My thesis revealed adaptive mechanisms in response to stress, including:  
- Differential gene expression,  
- Evidence of antisense genes,  
- Transcriptional mutagenesis,  
- Reverse transcriptase–like proteins integrating transcriptional variants into DNA.  

My PhD was conducted while working full-time for **[EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)** and in collaboration with Aristotle University and JGI.

## Pioneering Genomic Resources with Ensembl
A defining stage of my career was at the **[European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)** and the **[Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/)**.  

Here, I contributed to one of the world’s most critical genomic resources: the **[Ensembl platform](https://www.ensembl.org/)**. Key projects included:  

- **GRCh38 human genome annotation** (the current human reference genome)  
- **Illumina Human BodyMap project**  
- **The Human Pangenome Project** (featured on the cover of *Nature*)  
- Pipelines for **non-coding RNAs** (lncRNA) and **immune genes** (IG/TR)

I also led **multi-genome annotations** (primates, rodents), which laid the foundation for scalable high-throughput genome analysis at Ensembl.  
My contributions significantly expanded Ensembl’s role in global human genetics, enabling **high-quality genomic data access** for researchers, clinicians, and pharma R&D teams.

## International Collaborations and Industry Partnerships
During my time at Ensembl, I collaborated closely with academia and industry, tailoring genomic data resources to diverse needs.  
Key collaborators included:  
- **[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)**  
- **[University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/)**  
- **[Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/)**  

I contributed to **20+ custom genomics projects**, covering:  
- Model organism annotations  
- Single-cell experiments  
- Biomarker discovery  
- Therapeutic target identification  

I also supervised and mentored junior scientists, introducing **machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and containerized workflows** into production pipelines.

## Translational Bioinformatics and Healthcare Data
Following Ensembl, I transitioned into **translational bioinformatics** roles bridging research and healthcare.  

At **[Transition Bio](https://www.transition.bio/)** (Cambridge & Boston), I integrated **multi-omics data** into drug discovery, focusing on **biomolecular condensates** and therapeutic targets.  

At **[EULAR – European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology](https://www.eular.org/)**, I built **secure cloud-based platforms** for clinical and omics data collection, enabling:  
- Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, BCR/TCR-seq analysis  
- FAIR-compliant data sharing  
- Patient-focused translational research

These projects required close collaboration with **patient groups, clinicians, advocacy organizations, and pharmaceutical partners**.

## Publications and Research Impact
I have authored **26+ publications** in high-impact journals (*Nature, Science, Nucleic Acids Research*), cited **20,000+ times**.  

Highlights include:  
- Transcriptomic stress responses in microbial organisms  
- **Human Pangenome Project** (*Nature cover story*)  
- Genomics of unique species (*Tuatara*, Tasmanian devil transmissible cancers)

## Mentorship and Community Engagement
Beyond research, I have a strong commitment to training and outreach.  

- Delivered **15+ international workshops** (RNA-seq, Ensembl, IMG)  
- Tutor in the **Bioinformatics MSc** at the **University of Thessaly**  
- **Google Summer of Code mentor**  
- Active member of the **Hellenic Bioinformatics Association**
